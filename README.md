# users-manager

This project is an API developed in Node.js with Express.
The API provides the following services:
  - Register user
  - Login
  - Logout
  - Look for recipes (logged user only)
  - Get all queries

Theres a series of improvements that can be done to improve the API. For example, better middleware usage for security, error handling, etc..

In the future it would be nice to use an actual database to store information.
